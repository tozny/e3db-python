        Initialize the search v2 class.

        This object type is used to build a v2/search query to run against the server.
        It is exposed through the e3db.Client.search method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        next_token : int, optional
            Where to start the query at. E3DB will return an token which indicates
            where the  query left off. Another query can be executed including this next_token, and 
            it will pick off where the other left off (the default is 0, which starts from the beginning).

        count : int, optional
            How many records to include minimum of 1 and up to a maximum of 1000 (the default is 50).
            Based on the current version, the resulting query might return less than this count, even if
            there are more records available. The query will need to be re-run with the corresponding next_token.

        include_all_writers : bool, optional
            Whether or not to include all writers, or just the writer_id of the 
            (the default is False).

        include_data : bool, optional
            Whether to include data, or just meta data when retrieving the
            E3DB records (the default is False).

        match : [Params], optional
            A list of Search Param objects to Match when querying for Records
            (the default is None, which matches all records).

        exclude : [Params], optional
            A list of Search Param objects to Exclude when querying for Records
            (the default is None, which matches no records excluding nothing).

        range : Range, optional
            A Search Range object to filter results based on created or last_modified time
            (the default is None, which removes any time filter.).
